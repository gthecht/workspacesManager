BUGS:

  project:
    New files in the project folder currently aren't added to the project files. Add them each initialization?
    What data about the project should I keep in the appData folder?

  cli:
    Make the cli more readable. This includes less instruction and surrounding info. More dealing with the data itself.
    Show dataframes in a more readable manner - not all the columns have to appear.

  Relevance:
    Currently, the relevance parameter is just a function of open or closed. Change this to make it smarter.
    This will need more research and some algorithmics.

  Notes:
    Add notes functionality

  URLs:
    Add URL functionality.

PAST BUGS:

  appsGatherer.py:
    Make sure all the apps that are open, have an app from the apps df that fits them.
    Apps installed with the microsoft store aren't handled well. The are opened differently, not from the start exactly, and also it is harder to know if they are open.
    These apps use name and description of
      ApplicationFrameHost, Application Frame Host
      WWAHost, Microsoft WWA Host
    Which means that we need to identify them differently.

  powershellClient.py:
    parsing the data isn't perfect. Need to see how to split the lines in a better way.
    When the window title is too long, it messes with the beginning of the date column.

ARCHITECTURE:
  handlersManager - uses the apps handler, the explorer handler, the files handler and the url handler to see what's open and thus gather information for clustering.
  explorerHandler - retrieves information about open explorer windows
  appsGatherer     - retrieves info about open apps
  filesGatherer    - for open apps, get the files and their paths so that we can directly open the file and not the app
  urlsHandler     - irrespective of the browser, we want to get the urls that belong to the project

  project         - holds the data for the projects. This includes: files, (and paths), apps, and urls. For each one it has a time for when it was last opened, and how
                    much a part of the project it is (weight that when below a threshold, means that file doesn't belong to the prject anymore)
  projectsHandler - has all the projects, in charge of recognizing the current project and the current apps.
  clusterizer     - creates the project clusters from the data - is called by the projectsHandler
  endpoints       - this defines the API for the system - how to open and close projects, when to learn, or what to add to a project.
  index           - runs the whole app

NODE:
  The app will also have a gui, built in node and react, so that it can run either in electron, or on the browser.

FEATURES TO ADD:
  Add non latin characters to the apps - this may involve using something other than powershell to get the apps.
