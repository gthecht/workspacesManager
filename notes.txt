BUGS:
  appsHandler.py:
    powershell app isn't recognized in the open apps. Check which other one's aren't recognized well.
    Make sure all the apps that are open, have an app from the apps df that fits them.

ARCHITECTURE:
  handlersManager        - uses the apps handler, the explorer handler, the files handler and the url handler to see what's open and thus gather information for clustering.
  explorerHandler - retrieves information about open explorer windows
  appsHandler     - retrieves info about open apps
  filesHandler    - for open apps, get the files and their paths so that we can directly open the file and not the app
  urlsHandler     - irrespective of the browser, we want to get the urls that belong to the project

  project         - holds the data for the projects. This includes: files, (and paths), apps, and urls. For each one it has a time for when it was last opened, and how
                    much a part of the project it is (weight that when below a threshold, means that file doesn't belong to the prject anymore)
  projectsHandler - has all the projects, in charge of recognizing the current project and the current apps.
  clusterizer     - creates the project clusters from the data - is called by the projectsHandler
  endpoints       - this defines the API for the system - how to open and close projects, when to learn, or what to add to a project.
  index           - runs the whole app

NODE:
  The app will also have a gui, built in node and react, so that it can run either in electron, or on the browser.
